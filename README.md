:art: This is the third udemy app in the angular course, this one used the spotify API to get the latest releases, artists, and songs. :headphones:

We create the following pipes:
* **Noimage:** which controls the error of the requests that return the information of artists or albums without images, putting in its place a default image.
* **Domseguro:** when you call a url, through the domSanitizer it tells angular that it is safe.

We also use get and post requests.

Keep in mind that for now this application works with a token that must be generated in a POST request through the following endpoint: https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token and in the body it must have:
* **grant_type=**  client_credentials'
* **client_id =**
* **client_secret =**

Then you must take the generated token and put it in spotify.service.ts in the getQuery function after the token type that is Bearer, like this:

**'Authorization':'Bearer BQDf_v3AZu6k3qQjSRmmezmkgF-1FT4yaWLnEtcjHxTqNB1-ueu6c3WoSwjss7U2IQshqRxwb-Bs2sEPeqk'**

:microphone: Once ng serve starts running, the initial page will be the home page, where it presents the last 10 releases and is counted as the option to click to find information about the first artist that appears in the song, it shows the photo, the name and a table with their songs and albums.
It also has the search view, which allows you to write and returns the results of artists with that name.

:trumpet: The **the client_id** and the **secret** are generated by spotify developer when making a web dashboard, for more information enter the following link:

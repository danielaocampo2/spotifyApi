# Spotiapp

This is the third udemy app in the angular course, this one used the spotify API to get the latest releases, artists, and songs.

We create the following pipes:
* **Noimage:** which controls the error of the requests that return the information of artists or albums without images, putting in its place a default image.
* **Domseguro:** when you call a url, through the domSanitizer it tells angular that it is safe.

We also use get and post requests.

Keep in mind that for now this application works with a token that must be generated in a POST request through the following endpoint: https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token and in the body it must have:
* **grant_type=**  client_credentials'
* **client_id =**
* **client_secret =**

The **the client_id** and the **secret** are generated by spotify developer when making a web dashboard, for more information enter the following link:
